            The Seven Summits are the highest peaks on each of the Earth’s seven continents. However, there is
            disagreement about where the border between Europe and Asia is located in Russia. One commonly cited
            boundary for the easternmost edge of Europe is the Ural Mountains, which brings the Caucasus Mountains
            within Europe. The Caucasus’ tallest mountain, Elbrus, is 5,642 meters (18,510 feet) high, higher than
            Western Europe’s Mt. Blanc in the Alps, the European contender if the Caucaucas are instead considered
            within Asia. Elbrus has two summits, the east summit being the lower of the two at 5,621 meters, both of
            which are dominant volcanic domes.

            The first recorded climb of the mountain was in 1829 by Killar Khashirov, who reached the lower east summit.
            The higher west summit was reaching in 1874 when the guide Akhia Sottaiev led a team of British and Swiss
            climbers to the peak. During the early years of the Soviet Union, mountaineering became a popular sport of
            the masses, and there was tremedous traffic on the mountain. In the winter of 1936, a very large group of
            inexperienced Komsomol members attempted the mountain, and ended up suffering many fatalities when they
            slipped on the ice and fell to their deaths. The Germans briefly occupied the mountain during the Second
            World War; a possibly apocryphal story tells of a Soviet pilot being given a medal for bombing the main
            mountaineering hut, Pruit 11, while it was occupied. He was then later nominated for a medal for not hitting
            the hut, but instead the fuel supply, leaving the hut standing for future generations. From 1959 through
            1976, a cable car system was built in stages which can take visitors as high as 3,800 meters. There are a
            wide variety of routes up the mountain, but the normal route, which is free of crevasses, continues more or
            less straight up the slope from the end of the cable car system. During the summer, it is not uncommon for
            100 people to be attempting the summit via this route each day.

        Mt. Elbrus represents two summits of the extinct volcano – the Eastern by an altitude of 5621 m. above sea
        level, the Western-5642 m. above sea level. The main composition of the rocks – gneiss, granite, diabase
        tuffs and volcanic origin. It is located on the Bokovoy Ridge and joins the Main Caucasian Ridge by Hotutau
        Pass.
        The main part of the slopes are flat. The whole length of ski-tracks is more than 15 km. The longest one is
        “Stary Krugozor – Azau” – 2500 m. All ski tracks have a marking and serviced by snow tractors – special high
        mountain catterpillar tractor. Its possible skiing to high slopes of Elbrus with elevating by the
        snow-tractor.
        The surface of the height of 3500 m is mostly covered by glaciers (of 77), whose area 144.5 sq.km. On the
        free surface of the glaciers – moraines. Most of the slopes – are flat, but the height of 4000 m average
        slope reaches – 35 degrees. On the western and northern slopes there are steep rocky sections to a height of
        700 m. The glaciers are cut up with the cracks and in the bottom they end with the icefalls. There are a lot
        of cracks, vertical rocky-ice segments, and icefalls on the northern and western slopes. Below 3500 m rock
        stone debris and often in the summer, covered with melting snow fields.
